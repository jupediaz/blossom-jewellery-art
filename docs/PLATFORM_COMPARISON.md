# Blossom - E-Commerce Platform Comparison

Last Updated: 2026-02-12

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Start with Shopify Basic (39 EUR/mo) + Mavon Jewelry Theme (280 USD one-time)**

For a starting artisan jewelry business, Shopify provides the best balance of professional presentation, built-in e-commerce, Instagram integration, and manageable costs. A custom Next.js build would save on monthly fees but cost significantly more in development time and ongoing maintenance.

## Recommended Strategy: Multi-Channel

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Shopify + Instagram

- **Shopify Basic** with Mavon Jewelry theme as the brand home
- Connect Instagram Shopping
- Own domain (blossomjewelry.com or similar)
- Cost: ~130 EUR to start (1 EUR first month + theme + domain)

### Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Add Etsy

- List bestselling pieces on Etsy for discovery
- Drive Etsy customers to own website for repeat purchases
- Use Etsy as a traffic and credibility channel

### Phase 3 (Months 6-12): Evaluate Amazon + Custom Site

- If standardized pieces sell well, add Amazon Handmade (FBM first)
- If outgrowing Shopify or wanting more control, consider migrating to custom Next.js
- Continue Shopify as long as the economics work

### Alternative: Custom Build from Day 1

If we want to avoid monthly Shopify fees and have full control:
- Use **Medusa** or **NextMerce** as a starter
- Deploy on Vercel (free tier)
- Integrate Stripe for payments
- Build a beautiful, bespoke jewelry website
- Cost: Our development time + ~15 EUR/year

**Trade-off:** More upfront work but lower ongoing costs and complete control. Given our tech capabilities, this is viable.
