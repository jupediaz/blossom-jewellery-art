# Blossom - Naming & Domain Strategy

Last Updated: 2026-02-12

## Brand Name Analysis

### Current Name: "Blossom"

**Strengths:**
- Evocative, connects directly to the botanical/floral product line
- International (works in English, recognizable in Spanish)
- Emotional resonance: blooming, growth, new beginnings
- Aligns perfectly with the brand story ("Blooming Where You're Planted")
- Instagram already established: @blossomjewelleryart

**Risks:**
- "Blossom Jewelry" is CROWDED:
  - blossomjewelry.co exists (Blossom Jewelry Co)
  - jewelleryblossom.com exists (Jewelry Blossom, registered trademark)
  - Bloom & Blossom Jewelry exists (on Faire)
  - byolha.com is taken (registered Aug 2025 by someone else)
- Trademark risk in Class 14 (jewelry) -- needs legal review before investing heavily

**Recommendation:** Keep "Blossom" but differentiate with a modifier or creative domain. The Instagram handle @blossomjewelleryart provides a natural path.
