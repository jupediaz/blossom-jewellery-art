## Blossom Recommended Pricing

### Retail Prices (B2C)

| Product Type | Price Range (EUR) | Justification |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Earrings (simple)** | 45-65 | Entry point, accessible, gift-friendly |
| **Earrings (statement)** | 70-120 | Detailed work, conversation pieces |
| **Necklaces (pendant)** | 80-150 | Wearable daily, strong visual impact |
| **Necklaces (statement)** | 150-250 | 10-15+ hours work, centerpiece items |
| **Bracelets** | 60-150 | Depends on complexity |
| **Bridal/special occasion** | 200-500+ | Custom, premium positioning |
| **Custom commissions** | Starting 150 EUR | Premium for personalization |

### Why These Prices Work

1. **Time investment:** 8-12+ hours per piece at EUR 15-20/hr effective rate
2. **Materials:** Premium clay (Premo/FIMO), quality findings (14K gold-filled, titanium)
3. **Marbella market expectations:** Tourist/expat spending skews upward
4. **Comparable artists:** Artful Home artists sell polymer clay at $65-$650
5. **Psychology of pricing:** $49.99 outsells $28 for the same product in artisan markets

### Pricing Formula

```
Retail Price = (Materials + Labor + Overhead) x 2.5-3.0

Where:
- Materials: Clay (~2-5 EUR) + Findings (~3-8 EUR) + Packaging (~6-12 EUR)
- Labor: Hours x EUR 15-25/hr (skill-adjusted)
- Overhead: 15-20% of above (workspace, tools, marketing)
```

Example for a statement necklace:
- Materials: 8 EUR + Findings: 10 EUR + Packaging: 8 EUR = 26 EUR
- Labor: 12 hours x 20 EUR = 240 EUR
- Overhead (15%): 40 EUR
- Cost: 306 EUR
- Retail (x1.0 markup on labor-heavy items): ~150-200 EUR
- Note: For labor-heavy handmade, you can't always do 3x. Target 40%+ net margin.

## Wholesale Pricing (B2B)

Standard wholesale model: **50% of retail price**

| Product | Retail | Wholesale | Your Margin |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Simple earrings (45 EUR) | 45 EUR | 22 EUR | ~40% after costs |
| Statement earrings (100 EUR) | 100 EUR | 50 EUR | ~55% after costs |
| Pendant necklace (120 EUR) | 120 EUR | 60 EUR | ~50% after costs |
| Statement necklace (200 EUR) | 200 EUR | 100 EUR | ~60% after costs |

**Important:** Build wholesale margins into retail pricing from day one. If you can't sell wholesale at 50% off retail and still maintain 30%+ margin, the retail price is too low.

### Consignment Terms
- Boutique keeps 40-50% of retail price
- Monthly settlement
- Unsold pieces returned after 60-90 days

## Sales Channel Fee Impact

| Channel | Fee Structure | Net on 100 EUR sale |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Own website (Stripe)** | 1.5% + 0.25 EUR | ~98 EUR |
| **Shopify** | 39 EUR/mo + 2% + Stripe fees | ~95 EUR |
| **Etsy** | ~10-12% total | ~88-90 EUR |
| **Amazon Handmade** | 15% referral | ~85 EUR |
| **Local market** | Stall fee (50-100 EUR/day) | ~90-95 EUR per sale |
| **Boutique wholesale** | 50% retail | 50 EUR |
| **Boutique consignment** | 40-50% retail | 50-60 EUR |

### Recommendation

- **Highest margin:** Own website + Stripe (invest here)
- **Best discovery:** Etsy + Instagram (drives new customers)
- **Volume potential:** Amazon Handmade (standardized pieces only)
- **Local credibility:** Boutiques + markets (builds brand story)

## Price Anchoring Tactics

1. Always mention hours of labor in product descriptions
2. Show the making process (content that builds perceived value)
3. Position prices relative to other artisan jewelry, NOT mass-market
4. Use "starting at" language for custom work
5. Offer tiered collections (entry point + premium) to capture different budgets
6. Limited editions at higher price points create upward price perception
