    "handmadeIn": "Handmade in",
    "europe": "Europe",
    "bio1": "Every petal, every leaf, every tiny bud is sculpted by hand with the same love that nature puts into growing a flower. Olha transforms polymer clay into miniature botanical masterpieces — wearable art that carries the soul of handcraft.",
    "bio2": "Born in Ukraine with a background in psychology and education, Olha discovered her true calling in the art of polymer clay flower sculpting. What began as a creative escape became a lifelong passion — each piece a meditation on beauty and patience.",
    "bio3": "Now based in Europe, she draws inspiration from both her Ukrainian floral heritage — the vibrant poppies, golden sunflowers, and intricate vyshyvanka patterns — and the lush Mediterranean gardens that surround her.",
    "craftTitle": "The Craft",
    "craftSubtitle": "Sculpted by Hand, Petal by Petal",
    "craft1": "Each flower begins as a small piece of polymer clay, carefully conditioned and coloured to achieve the perfect natural shade. Using only her hands and simple sculpting tools, Olha forms every petal individually — building up roses, orchids, peonies, and wildflowers that look as if they were just picked from a garden.",
    "craft2": "No moulds. No shortcuts. No two pieces are exactly alike. A single necklace can take days to complete, with dozens of hand-sculpted flowers and leaves assembled into a harmonious bouquet.",
    "craft3": "The finished flowers are carefully cured, then combined with sterling silver findings, natural semi-precious stones, Swarovski crystals, and crystal beads to create pieces that are both delicate and durable.",
    "specialTitle": "What Makes Blossom Special",
    "value1Title": "100% Handcrafted",
    "value1Text": "Every flower is sculpted by hand from polymer clay. No moulds, no mass production — each piece is a unique work of art with its own character and personality.",
    "value2Title": "Nature-Inspired",
    "value2Text": "Real flowers fade, but Olha's botanical creations last forever. Inspired by roses, orchids, peonies, and wildflowers from Ukrainian fields to Mediterranean gardens.",
    "value3Title": "Quality Materials",
    "value3Text": "Sterling silver findings, Swarovski crystals, natural agate and amethyst stones. Every component is chosen for beauty and durability, ensuring pieces you'll treasure.",
    "workshopTitle": "The Workshop",
    "workshopSubtitle": "Where Flowers Come to Life",
    "workshop1": "Olha's atelier is a small, sunlit space surrounded by inspiration — real flowers, colour swatches, and trays of tiny clay petals in various stages of creation.",
    "workshop2": "It's here that each collection is born: from the first colour experiments to the final quality check before packaging. Every piece is made to order with the same attention to detail, whether it's a simple pair of stud earrings or an elaborate bridal necklace.",
    "creativeProcess": "The Creative Process",
